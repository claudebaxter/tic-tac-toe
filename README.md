#tic-tac-toe-react

This is an attempt to deploy a tic-tac-toe react app to gh-pages.

You can test the application on GH-Pages <a href=https://elborracho420.github.io/tic-tac-toe title="Tic Tac Toe"> here.</a>

This game lets you:

1) Play tic-tac-toe,

2) Indicates when a player has won the game,

3) Stores a game's history as a game progresses,

4) Allows players to review a game's history and see previous versions of a game's board.
